I'm a computer science student at Calstate Fullerton. I'm going for my bachelor's degree, but maybe I'll go for my master's if I decide to.

## Favorite CPSC120L labs

Lab 1
This lab is one of my favorites mainly because it’s the first one we did in class, and it showed me what coding can be if I put time into it. While it was simple and just a way to get familiar with the software, I think it was still a neat and memorable first introduction to coding. It was interesting to see how we can utilize code to write a statement like hello world, and it got me interested in what else coding has to offer. 

Lab 6
This lab was memorable, because I like the concept of it. I thought the part 1 section with the mad libs was pretty fun to do, and this lab interested me a lot. Another reason why it was so memorable for me is because most of the work I had to do myself. When the class ended, my partner never responded to me until after I had completed the lab, meaning I had to do most of the lab myself. However, I’ve come to realize that this wasn’t the worst experience for me, as I feel it helped me learn a bit more about coding than I would've otherwise, and gave me a bit more confidence in my coding skills.


Lab 9
This lab I liked because I feel that this is one of the few labs I feel like my partner really clicked. I feel this lab is the most effective me and a partner have been, and I  think that made this lab much more enjoyable. We got a decent amount of it done in class, and afterwards, I was able to get it done pretty easily. I feel that having a good partner in a lab makes it a lot more fun to do, and I think that really helped me in getting this lab done efficiently.
